# ResearchScope: Graph Neural Networks for Automated Research Classification and Hypothesis Generation

## Proposed arXiv Paper Outline

### Authors
Derek Green (OrbitScope Research)

### Abstract (250 words)
We present ResearchScope, an automated research intelligence system combining Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with knowledge graph analysis for scientific paper classification and hypothesis generation. The system processes 31,128 research papers from multiple disciplines, achieving 85%+ F1 score in category prediction while maintaining interpretable reasoning chains. Our approach addresses key challenges in automated research synthesis: author disambiguation (99.7% recovery rate), multi-source data integration (5-tier cascading API architecture), and graph-enhanced feature learning. Unlike traditional citation networks, we incorporate author collaboration patterns and semantic embeddings (SciBERT) to capture research community dynamics. The system demonstrates practical applications in automated literature review, research gap identification, and evidence-based hypothesis generation. Evaluation on ArXiv dataset shows significant improvements over baseline approaches, with potential applications in accelerating scientific discovery and democratizing research synthesis capabilities.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Motivation
- Exponential growth of scientific literature (millions of papers annually)
- Manual literature review increasingly impractical
- Need for automated, evidence-based research synthesis
- Gap: Existing tools lack graph-aware reasoning and author collaboration signals

### 1.2 Contributions
1. Multi-tier author recovery system (95%+ coverage from incomplete metadata)
2. Hybrid graph representation (citations + co-authorship + semantic embeddings)
3. GraphSAGE-based classification achieving 85%+ F1 score
4. Open-source framework for research intelligence automation

### 1.3 System Overview
- Input: Raw paper metadata (title, abstract, authors)
- Processing: Neo4j knowledge graph + PyTorch Geometric GNN
- Output: Category predictions, research trends, hypothesis generation

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Citation Network Analysis
- Traditional citation networks (PageRank, co-citation analysis)
- Limitations: Ignore author collaboration, semantic content

### 2.2 Research Paper Classification
- Supervised learning on abstracts (BERT, SciBERT)
- Graph-based methods (GCN, GAT)
- Gap: Limited author network integration

### 2.3 Author Disambiguation
- Name matching algorithms
- Our contribution: Cascading multi-source API approach

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Data Collection Pipeline
```
ArXiv API → Semantic Scholar API → Multi-tier Recovery
    ↓
Neo4j Knowledge Graph (31,128 papers, author networks)
    ↓
PyTorch Geometric Dataset (edge_index, node features)
```

### 3.2 Multi-Tier Author Recovery
**Problem:** 19% of papers lack complete author metadata

**Solution: 5-Tier Cascading Architecture**
1. Tier 1: Free APIs (OpenAlex, CrossRef, DBLP)
2. Tier 2: Domain-specific (PubMed, Europe PMC)
3. Tier 3: DOI resolution
4. Tier 4: Text extraction/pattern matching
5. Tier 5: Manual lookup fallback

**Results:** 99.7% recovery rate on processed papers

### 3.3 Graph Construction
**Nodes:** Research papers
**Edges:**
- Citation links (paper → cited_paper)
- Co-authorship (papers by same author)
- Category similarity (for validation)

**Node Features:**
- SciBERT embeddings (768-dim, from title + abstract)
- Metadata features (publication year, citation count)
- Author network features (collaboration degree, community centrality)

### 3.4 GNN Architecture
```
GraphSAGE (2-layer)
    Layer 1: 768 → 512 (mean aggregation)
    Layer 2: 512 → num_categories
    Activation: ReLU
    Dropout: 0.3
    Loss: CrossEntropyLoss
```
